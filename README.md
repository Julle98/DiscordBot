# Sannamaija-V2
Newer version with cool new features and more. The bot is still not public!
The bot works fine with Visual Studio Code and Python extension from Microsoft. 

I don't know if it work somewhere else than Visual Studio Code but code extensions are there so big recommendation to run it on Visual Studio Code.

The main language in the bot are Finnish and you can always change it to English if you want.

The code contain lot of commands over 45 commands.

# Instructions for deploying the bot
1. Download Visual Studio Code.
2. Download all the files in the repository. Zip file is good option.
3. Download pip extensions at requirements.txt file. Big recommendation to some kind of virtual environment! 
4. Change the .env file data to your own.
5. Run the file and have fun!
- Also you need make a bot in the Discord Developer Portal.
